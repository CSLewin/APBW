# A History of Known Eloran

"If there were other empires before the Eloran Empire, we have not been taught of them. If there are other empires to come, they will not deserve the title.*"

Picture a rectangle drawn over a map of Earth. The four corners are pinned to Ireland, southwestern Algeria, northeastern Mongolia, and Thailand. This is, roughly, the geography of Known Eloran, and the former territory of the Eloran Empire. If you are pressed for time, you could imagine Rome and you wouldn't be too far off. Ultimately, Rome dissolved. The Eloran Empire did not.

**The third most notable thing the Eloran Empire accomplished was mastering teleportation.** 

This was an early triumph, and the core of their power. When the nascent Empire mobilized to conquer the other nations of the continent, they were unburdened by the need for roads, ships, or supply lines. Armies rarely met Eloran soldiers on the battlefield; it was much more expedient for the Empire to teleport soldiers directly into the throne rooms of enemy rulers and politely take their entire courts prisoner. The Eloran Empire did not field siege engines; when a region would not yield, notice was given in ten languages for three days before a stubborn holdfast was abruptly buried under a mountain's mass of white stone and sand. The Empire could not be invaded in return, as their homeland in the southeast of the continent was a vast, mountainous desert--tremendously difficult to traverse on foot or horseback, as the Empire maintained no roads. The Eloran Empire's War of Unification lasted just under two years, and was--aside from a few early incidents--remarkably light on casualties and collateral damage. 

**The second most notable thing the Eloran Empire accomplished was successfully yoking the other nations of Known Eloran as client states.**

After the nations of the continent had been conquered--Anem, Pirra, the island of Temen--the Empire made few demands. Regional governors were appointed from the native Aneman, Pirran, and Temenite populations, and instructed to collect taxes of local luxuries and raw materials. The imperial quotas were commensurate with the regional ability to produce, and the Empire guaranteed peace and prosperity in return. The entire population of each client state were considered citizens of the Empire, and fully protected under Eloran Imperial law. Where it still existed (mostly in Temen), inter-generational slavery was abolished. Imperial schools were established and staffed by Eloran instructors; 80 years after the War of Unification, one citizen out of three could read and write. Newspapers were invented. Printed books became popular. Writing desks and reading chairs became common. Cities grew. Infant mortality shrank. 150 years after the War, it wasn't unusual for the wealthy to see their sixth decade. Conflict between the Empire and the eastern island nations, Chernik and the Kingdom of Jhilal, was limited to the occasional coastal raid. The world turned.

Until the Tithe of Years began.

200 years after the War of Unification, an additional tax was imposed on client states of the Eloran Empire. During their registration as citizens, newborns were presented to Eloran magisters who would use their art to siphon one year of life from the wailing infant. Parents could opt to offer their own year of life in place of their child, and often did--it was the price of citizenship. 

The tithe's presence grew. Crimes punishable by execution replaced the headsman's sword with the lingering touch of a magister. Imperial fines became payable in bartered goods, imperial coin, months of slavery--or years of life. The destitute among the citizenry were hardest-hit. White hair and wrinkled faces bloomed throughout urban crowds and rural communities.



The Eloran Empire ruled the continent for just under 230 years.

The third most notable thing the Eloran Empire accomplished was vanishing overnight.
