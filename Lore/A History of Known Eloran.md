# A History of Known Eloran

## The Eloran Empire

*"If there were other empires before the Eloran Empire, we have not been taught of them. If there are other empires to come, they will not deserve the title."*

> I didn't *mean* for this setting writeup to turn into a commentary on unregulated experimentation by the social elite on the shared commons, the inherent dangers of closed-source information networks, and tribalism, but here we are.

Picture a rectangle drawn over a map of Earth. The four corners are pinned to Ireland, southwestern Algeria, northeastern Mongolia, and Thailand. This is, roughly, the geography of Known Eloran, and the former territory of the Eloran Empire. If you are pressed for time, imagine Imperial Rome and you won't be too far off; other excellent options include Byzantium, Imperial China, or Imperial India. 

The cultural inspiration for the Eloran Empire isn't as important as their key accomplishments. Ultimately, the Roman empire dissolved. After more than two centuries of uncontestable dominance, the Eloran Empire did something more interesting.

### Travel Without Movement

The third most notable thing the Eloran Empire accomplished was a mastery of teleportation. 

This was the first triumph and the core of their power. When the nascent Empire mobilized to conquer the continent, they were unburdened by the need for roads, ships, or supply lines. Armies rarely met Eloran soldiers on the battlefield; it was much more expedient for the Empire to teleport soldiers directly into the throne rooms of enemy rulers and politely take their entire courts prisoner. The Eloran Empire did not field siege engines; when a region would not yield, notice was given in ten languages for three days before a stubborn holdfast was abruptly buried under a several hundred tons of white stone and sand. The Empire could not be invaded in return, as their homeland in the southeast of the continent was a vast, mountainous desert--tremendously difficult to traverse on foot or horseback, as the Empire maintained no roads. The Eloran Empire's War of Unification lasted just under two years, and was--aside from a few early incidents--remarkably light on casualties and collateral damage.

### Yoking the Continent

The second most notable thing the Eloran Empire accomplished was successfully yoking the other continental nations as client states.

After the nations of the continent had been conquered--Anem, Pirra, the island of Temen--the Empire made few demands. Regional governors were appointed from the native Aneman, Pirran, and Temenite populations, and instructed to collect taxes of local luxuries and raw materials. The imperial quotas were commensurate with the regional ability to produce, and the Empire guaranteed peace and prosperity in return. The entire population of each client state were considered citizens of the Empire, and fully protected under Eloran Imperial law. Where it still existed (mostly in Temen), inter-generational slavery was abolished. Imperial schools were established and staffed by Eloran instructors; 80 years after the War of Unification, one in three citizens could read and write. Newspapers were invented. Printed books became popular. Writing desks and reading chairs became common. Cities grew. Infant mortality shrank. 150 years after the War, it wasn't unusual for the wealthy to see their sixth decade. Conflicts between the Empire and the eastern island nations, Chernik and the Kingdom of Jhilal, were limited to the rare coastal raid. The world turned on.

### **The Tithe of Years**

200 years after the War of Unification, an additional tax was imposed on client states of the Eloran Empire. During their registration as citizens, newborns were presented to Eloran magisters who would use their art to siphon seven years from the far end of wailing infant's life. Parents could opt to give their own years in place of those of their child, and often did. Refusal of the tithe was punished with revocation of citizenship and banishment. Many families refused. The hills swelled with outlaws, who quickly turned to banditry to survive.

Bounties on outlaws became commonplace. Professional bounty hunters, necessary but hated for hunting their own kin, circulated. An Aneman inventor created the pneumatic rifle.

The Empire's hunger for years grew, and the tithe spread. Crimes punishable by execution replaced the headsman's sword with the lingering touch of an imperial magister. Fines became payable in bartered goods, minted coin, months of slavery--or years of life. With no currency but time, youth withered among the most destitute of the citizenry. White hair bloomed across market-day crowds like pale mold on soft fruit.

The tithe of years was funneled back to the seat of the Eloran Empire. Thousands of humming brass vessels, etched with the blocky script of the _lingua prima_ and brimming with youth, vanished into the southeastern desert citadels. Mundane taxation slackened and was forgotten rather than abolished; the Eloran Empire demanded no new luxuries, no raw metals or heavy gems--only a tide of years.

Hardy caravans were chartered to the Eloran deserts seeking clarity, dispatched in the hope that diplomacy might solve what riot and rebellion could not possibly effect. After months of travel, the diplomatic caravans were treated with subtlety and kindness--but as children, to be pampered, soothed, and ultimately sent home in ignorance. The Emperor of Known Eloran would not receive guests. His work, it was explained, was too important to disturb.

An Aneman diplomat reported to his king that the tithe of years was not destined exclusively for the Emperor and his court, but was also used to create sleepless workers from raw clay. Towering academies and cathedrals shadowed the white dunes, but no men or women bore the sweat of labor on their brow within the citadel. 

A Pirran scholar reported to her colleagues at the Libussan Academy that art--etched, written, woven, played, sung, danced, sculpted, glazed, or a hundred hundred other means--overflowed from the avenues of the Imperial citadels, all exclusively produced by a caste of lithe, manic aesthetes. Endless crafts, strange and wonderful, poured from every workshop, but no men or women stirred themselves to creation within the citadel.

Temen sent no delegations. One by one, each Temenite clan had declared itself outlaw and retreated into the wild snows. The empire did not give chase. The magisters returned from that distant, frozen island to the far deserts. The walled cities were abandoned to migrant seabirds and the rough grip of wild winter roses.

### The Looming Moon

The third most notable thing the Eloran Empire accomplished was vanishing overnight.

Square-edged chunks of the Eloran Empire's homeland ranging in size from a single building to 10 square city blocks were teleported across the planet, each section of turf and construction exchanged seemingly at random with a similarly sized portion of land, complete with animals, plants, and people. ~90% of living creatures so displaced were killed, either by collapsing rubble, falling through hundreds of feet of elevation difference, trauma and suffocation from partial coincidence with other objects, or secondary victims of injury, starvation, thirst, or the chaos that broke out among the survivors.

The moon abruptly appeared ten times larger and closer to the planet, pinned in geostationary orbit over a large, geothermally-active island midway between the eastern Pirran coast and Jhilal. Tidal charts and coastal maps across the world were rendered useless overnight. A 2000-mile-wide lunar shadow--**the Moonshadow**--fundamentally changed the sea and island below it. Most plants died within weeks from the lack of sunlight and terrible cold. Animals that could not hunt each other quickly withered.

Three months later, spores from the Looming Moon made landfall on Known Eloran. Lava drawn from the depths of the planet by the moon's gravity reached the surface, and the Moonshadow changed again--from a wasteland choked with rotting greenery and starving predators to a blooming fungal hell. Some predators adapted to hunt each other; some were _changed_. Drifting steam wreathed towering clusters of fruiting bodies and mycoprotein biomass, all backlit by the lurid, neon flames of the burning breath of the earth.

The Eloran Emperor, his courtiers and advisors, his entire high council of Luminous Magisters, and every single orchard and fruit tree in the Imperial Homeland vanished entirely. With the disappearance of the Luminous Magisters, The Imperial Citadel has never been found elsewhere, and rumors insist that is remains the only building undisturbed by the catastrophe of the Looming Moon, still casting a long shadow over a perfect, mile-wide circle of white sand.

# Magic

[This is an explanation for why standard D&D Vancian magic doesn't work any more, but also why the assumptions of the setting are that the Eloran Empire had access to it.]

Magic has broken. 

It was never a sure thing, but the Empire believed they understood it, and few could say otherwise. Per Imperial doctrine, magic was a wild energy of unknown origin that could be accessed with careful ritual and mental preparation. The mortal mind could, at best, comprehend these energies through a darkling glass, like a child peeking through a keyhold, and only through rote memorization. The rituals used to compel magical energy were exhaustively catalogued; experiments were conducted to explore the limits of magical possibility, and firm guidelines were written to prevent an errant magister 

The mortal mind can, at best, consider the complexities Imperial Magisters memorized
