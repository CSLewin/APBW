Core Design Pillars:

1: Everyone at the table, including the GM, gets to experience the joy of surprise.

2: Verisimilitude and internal consistency are more important than realism.

3: Push-your-luck mechanics at the micro and macro level balance player system mastery with the necessity of player adaptability.

4: Narrative prompts are more interesting and useful than predetermined canon.
