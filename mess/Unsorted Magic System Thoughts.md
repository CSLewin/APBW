# Magic?

Flesh - Summoning - This is a good skillset to have all-around.
	abjuration - ward/block/banish/protect/remove
	conjuration - call from elsewhere (creatures, objects/substances)

	The latest development in the brave new post-Bitcoin world is crypto-equity. At this point I’ve gone from wanting to praise these inventors as bold libertarian heroes to wanting to drag them in front of a blackboard and making them write a hundred times “I WILL NOT CALL UP THAT WHICH I CANNOT PUT DOWN”

Mind - Beguiling - These seem well-linked.
	enchantment - manipulate minds, emotions, thoughts
	illusion - Warp and beguile the senses. False seemings.

Spirit - Divination and Necromancy go hand-in-hand when the dead live beyond time.
	divination - perception, knowledge, prediction
	necromancy - Manipulate life, death, the dead, and undead.


True Speech:
evocation - Produce energy from nowhere. Damage.
transmutation - Transform energy and matter to other forms.

TO DESCRIBE A THING PERFECTLY IS TO NAME IT.
TO NAME A THING IS TO DESCRIBE IT PERFECTLY.

True Names are powerful, useful, dangerous things in the same way that gravity is powerful, useful, and dangerous.

The Aerial Spirits are not the names they present; each IS a hidden, individual name as complex as the ENNEAGRAM they contribute themselves toward as a group. This correctly implies that only 1/9th of the individual spirit is present in the world, and that the nine of them are collaborating.

A person's true name is how they address themselves in their own thoughts. Sometimes that's a single given name; sometimes it's a litany of given name, family name, patronym/matronym, clan name, and title. Players should write down their character's true name at character creation. A character's true name could change during gameplay, but such an event would be as significant as the character's fundamental nature changing; it should never be a trivial or casual moment.

If a sorcerer knows your true name, they may use it to affect you with their powers at any distance.
