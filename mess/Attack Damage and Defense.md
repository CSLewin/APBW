# Attack/Defense by HD size

## Defense

When something might cause you harm, your character's ability to avoid or resist injury is represented by a roll of their **defense die**. 
- **Physical attacks** are resisted using your character's **physical discipline die**.
- **Mental attacks** are resisted using your character's **mental discipline die**.

When your character attempts to avoid harm, roll your character's relevant defense die. **Take one hit for each defense die on which you roll a 1 or lower.**

Some equipment (like shields) or special techniques may allow you to add one of your stats to your defense roll. Some dangerous enemies will require you to subtract a number from your defense die roll. Some *very* dangerous enemies may require you to roll your defense die multiple times against a single attack.

Hits represent your character's capacity to reduce the impact of a potentially deadly blow to one that merely inflicts a flesh wound or demands a tiring effort to avoid. Taking a hit does not mean your character survived a deep stab to the heart or the full brunt of a bolt of lightning--merely that they avoided the worst of it. 

Your character can endure a maximum number of hits equal to **2 + 1/2 their level (rounded down) + the character's Grit**. 
- Example: A 1st level character with a Grit of 0 has 2 (base) + (1st level/2 = 0.5, rounded down to 0) + 0 (Grit) = 2 maximum hits.
- Example: A 3rd level character with a Grit of 2 has 2 (base) + (3rd level/2 = 1.5, rounded down to 1) + 2 (Grit) = 5 maximum hits.

If your character has taken their maximum number of hits and receives any additional hits, they receive one **DIRE WOUND** per hit received beyond their maximum. When this happens, immediately roll 1d6 per DIRE WOUND, total the results, and apply the matching number and source of damage from the DIRE WOUNDS Chart to your character. All DIRE WOUND results stack with themselves and each other.

Example: Balthazar the mercenary is fighting for his life against a pair of assassins. Balthazar isn't wearing any armor, but he's a skilled warrior and has a d10 Hit Die.

The first assassin tries to stab him with a long knife. This attack is represented in the assassin's stats as "Long Knife 1d". Balthazar rolls his Hit Die and gets a 4. Since that's higher than 1, Balthazar takes no damage; his player describes this as a flick of his sword parrying the assassin's long knife.

The second assassin is far more skilled than the first, and knows a secret Kidney Gouging technique. This is represented in the second assassin's stats as "Kidney Gouge 2d (-2)". Balthazar rolls his d10 Hit Die twice and subtracts two from each individual roll. The first die comes up a 3. Normally this would be fine, but 3-2 = 1, and a roll of 1 or lower reduces a target's Hit Die by one size! Balthazar's second roll of his d10 Hit Die was a 1. Alas! 1-2 = -1, certainly low enough to be a hit.

Balthazar's Hit Die is reduced two sizes, down from a d10 to a d6.  

The GM describes the second assassin's attack connecting, although the mercenary twists away from the assassin before a vital artery is severed. Balthazar is wounded and things aren't looking good. The fight continues...

Level 20 bulwark capstone: your hit die is a d20

Necromancer capstone: Frailty's shield. Your target must roll his health die. If he does not roll its maximum value, it dies

Cleric: Relentless aura. All allies close to the cleric treat their health die as one larger.
Do not walk away from the cleric if your effective health die is a 1
Huh. A phylactery is voluntarily reducing your health die, putting it into an item, and repeating that until your body's health is zero
More necromancer fuel

Paladin: Martyr's warrant. You may roll your health die in place of an ally's

Barbarian: berserk. For each step that your health to die decreases, increase your damage die

Rogue: assassinate. Your target must roll their health die (your level) times

Immortal challenge: The bulwark may choose to willingly fail a health die roll. If he does, his attacker may not move away from the bulwark unless he drops his weapon, and may not attack any target but the bulwark for (rounds)
(Willingly catching the blade and swinging a motherfucker around by it)

Tricky resilience: Once per encounter a rogue may dodge and redirect an attack. When be would be struck, he does not take damage, and rolls a d4. On a 1, he may attack his attacker with a riposte. The attacker is considered unaware of the riposte

Vita theft: The vivomancer attacks a target. If he succeeds, the target must roll his health die once for every ally of the vivomancer within (melee) range. Each time he takes damage, one ally of the vivomancer heals by one die step

Barkskin: a target of this spell may reroll one health die check. Duration: one hour or until expended
Stone skin: a target of this spell my reroll two health die checks. Duration: one hour or until expended
Ironskin: a target of this spell may reroll three health die checks. Duration: one hour or until expended
Diamond skin: a target of this spell may reroll four health die checks. Duration: one hour or until expended

Blood bomb: after three rounds, the target of this spell releases a blast of energy proportionate to the damage he has taken since the spell was cast. When the spell expires, creatures within (range) must roll one health die check for every time the target of the spell was injured during the spell's duration

Parasitosis: the druid summons swarms of insects beneath the Target's skin. He must make a health die check every round. The effect ends when the target succeeds on (number) consecutive health die checks

Armor shrapnel: the gunslinger fires with the intention of blasting the Target's armor into his chest cavity. On a successful attack ,treat the Target's armor as a penalty to his health die check

In the thick of it: when the doppelsoldner is within melee range of three or more enemies, he automatically succeeds on the first health die check of each round

Doom: grant target an invisible d20 hit die, that decreases by one step at the end of each of their turns and when they take damage to their visible hit die. When the invisible die breaks, so too does their visible, unless counteracted beforehand.
	A countdown, basically. doesn't need to be a hit die, but thematic for the mechanics. Jesus, this is a scary move.

Variations on Hit Die:
	- "Sturdy" vs. "Brittle" HD: sturdy ones behave as written, brittle HD break entirely with one failure (no matter their size)
		- A monster with four brittle d6 HD feels very different than one with one one sturdy d12
	- Reverse HD: Monster HD INCREASES as they get hit and freak out (d4 -> d6 -> d8 -> d10 -> d12 -> death)
	- HD could break at numbers above 1; using this as a temporary status could indicate weakness, distraction, or exposure
	- a creature with a tough shell but weak innards, represented by a progression of (d12 > d10 > d8 > death) rather than (d8 > d6 > d4 > death)


Healing Ideas in this Paradigm:
	- Healing Magic? Healing potions?
	- Straightforward: "increase target's hit die by one step, up to target's class maximum"
	- spells to add extra temporary hit die. give target a d4 for x rounds
	- Spell: grant target one temporary brittle d10 HD
