# Exhaustion

To do serious stuff (in or out of combat), you generate Momentum. In combat, you do that by rolling initiative and then spending it on your turn to strike, move, etc. This applies to magic too; you can get mentally blown out and just need to rest because you're figuratively brain-drained, like after studying for a really hard test, right? anyway.

You have inventory slots equal to 10 + Might.
You have **Stamina** equal to 10 + Grit.

Every time you generate momentum (so, each combat round, or whenever you try to do something difficult out of combat like weird magic crap or any non-automatically-succeeding skill check), **make a tally mark under your Stamina.**

When you have tally marks equal to your Stamina score, fill in an inventory slot with "EXHAUSTED" and erase all your tally marks. You can't use that inventory slot until you clear the EXHAUSTED out of it.

You clear one Exhausted inventory slot for every full hour of decent rest you get.

Realism isn't what makes for a good game, but it's nice for establishing benchmarks. I looked at Olympic wrestling for match numbers and bout lengths to try to pin what a possible peak of human physical effort would look like. This feels like a reasonable range. (You can still operate when all your inventory slots are Exhausted, but you're at a disadvantage to pretty much every physical action; it'd all but guarantee you'd lose a bout against an equally-skilled opponent that wasn't similarly exhausted.)

```3 minutes * 2 bouts * 5 matches = 30 minutes * 60 seconds = 1800 seconds```
```1800 seconds / 10-second combat rounds = 180 combat rounds per day```

- For a 5 Grit, 2 Might character: 180 combat rounds / 15 Stamina = 12.000 of 12 inventory slots filled (0.000 overflow)
- For a 4 Grit, 2 Might character: 180 combat rounds / 14 Stamina = 12.857 of 12 inventory slots filled (0.857 overflow)
- For a 3 Grit, 2 Might character: 180 combat rounds / 13 Stamina = 13.846 of 12 inventory slots filled (1.846 overflow)
- For a 2 Grit, 2 Might character: 180 combat rounds / 12 Stamina = 15.000 of 12 inventory slots filled (3.000 overflow)
- For a 1 Grit, 2 Might character: 180 combat rounds / 11 Stamina = 16.363 of 12 inventory slots filled (4.363 overflow)
- For a 0 Grit, 2 Might character: 180 combat rounds / 10 Stamina = 18.000 of 12 inventory slots filled (6.000 overflow)
