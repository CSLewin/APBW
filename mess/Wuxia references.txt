A silly list of common Wuxia tropes:

>Evil martial arts school who teaches a deadly forbidden technique 
>Tragic dramatic villain deaths 
>Villain who is the evil equivalent of a shounen hero 
>Badass girl fighters who inexplicably become helpless damsels if they A: are love interest of the MC and B: get grabbed by the villain 
>Evil pupil of the BBEG stabs him in the back and takes his place as BBEG 
>Girl fighters falling for guy fighters after a sparring match or vice versa 
>Devoted Confucian brotherly love 
>Picking fights over disrespect 
>Bystanders narrating whatever techniques are being used
>Special moves which tap into chi 
>Pussy magnet MC who attracts everything from farm girls to princesses 
>Girls somehow deal damage with slaps 
>Confucian loyalty tested: expect suicide or choosing a third option for a happy ending 
>Bad girl who leaves the villains after getting defeated/rescued by our noble MC then set on the path of Xia 
>People who screw over their families, friends, and especially master are worse than scum 
>Villain is often jealous of the MC (be it fame, earning respect of a great sifu, or their beautiful girlfriend)
>Eunuchs are evil scheming weirdos 
>The Emperor is the big good of the story and he just isn't aware of what the villains are up to at the time
>Your Sifu has a best friend who turned evil or became a grumpy hermit 
>Heroes and villains tend to get obsessed with each other, like Nardo & Saucegay obsessed

>Tsundere love interests everywhere 
>If you're a peasant farmer, run. Your land is probably sitting on shitloads of spiritual power buried somewhere. Expect villains to kill you and seize it. 
>Be nice to teahouse girls, they're probably the reincarnation of some glorious heroine or goddess. Expect them to be kidnapped by dark forces.
>Parents actually exist unlike anime and are happy to offer support (it would be nice if you became doctah tho)
>Masochistic MC hurts himself to get stronger

>The lovers who fight together

>The Austere female warrior

Also, magic and fighting go hand in hand so kung fu wizards are definetly a thing, Nothing like casting spells while boxing against a fellow wizard.
