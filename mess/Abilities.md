### Immortal (MD 1d12, PD 1d12)
- *What is the core conceit of this class?*
	- Pay the price to transcend mortality.
- *What is the base ability of this class?*
	- Immortality. Pick one thing that can no longer kill you: Age, Wounds, Magic(?). Pick one thing you have given up to obtain this power: Your memory, your humanity, your body.

**Being unable to be killed by age** is cool if you're going to lead a peaceful life, but you're still subject to death by physical wounds and magic, as well as ending up in a state where you don't want to live any more.

**Being unable to die from wounds** is awesome, but it's not the same thing as being immune to damage. You can be hacked apart, but you won't die from it. This can be a real problem; getting mashed to jam under a boulder tends to drive people insane; you're also not proofed against pain.

**Being unable to be slain by magic** is pretty useful, but that's direct "snuff out your soul" type stuff; a blast of flame might be magically created, but it's still fire and can burn you, and an iron weapon will do you in just fine. It stops a lot of sorcerous fuckery against you, however. Useful if you're frequently dealing with things that don't really *care* about your body.

**Giving up your memory** is something like an interpersonal rebirth. You retain all your skills and such, but you forget all your relationships and personal histories. The danger is that someone is waiting to lead you astray, but this sort of thing doesn't happen abruptly--you generally get to prepare for it. It's a big ritual.

**Giving up your humanity** is more esoteric--consider what it's like to turn on cheats in a difficult video game. Suddenly you can noclip through annoying terrain, spawn whatever endgame items you want, and have infinite gold--you're completely disengaged from the world's concerns. A player picking this is advised to continue to roleplay their character, but from the sort of cosmic position of realizing that everyone else is an RPG character written on a piece of paper, or merely a collection of atoms, or meat. Full-on Dr. Manhattan. This world doesn't matter any more than the untold other worlds scattered across the cosmos, although it might still be interesting.

**Giving up your body** is something like becoming a Force Ghost. You exist, you can talk and perceive and such, but you can't experience anything that you'd need a physical body to enjoy (or suffer from, honestly). Interaction is still very possible, but you'd better already have some method of interacting with the world that doesn't require hands or else you're gonna end up with a lot of problems.
