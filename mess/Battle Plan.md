# How am I going to write, test, promote, and release this RPG?

1. **Establish Fictional Pillars**
- Test line please delete
	- _SIC TRANSIT ARCANA | FERRUM AETERNUM_
	- Vanished empire, transitory age. The center cannot hold!
	- Humans only as PCs. Servitor races (Elves, Dwarves, Soldiers) have truly inhuman outlooks (partially because they're immortal).
		- Humans-only means lower cognitive load for players.
	- Heaven is real, but faith remains. God(s) is (are) distant, but the aerial spirits are near. Atheists exist.
	- Global politics as The Great Game (WWI-style). Smoldering war, privateerism, proxy forces, spies.
	- A society of heroes. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuxia#Jianghu Fame and the Jianghu concept. *The world needs heroes.*
		- **Somebody has to do it and nobody else will. --The Comet King"**

2. **Establish Design Pillars.**
	- What is this game? What is it **not**?

3. **Declare Chapters (add more later as/if needed)**

4. **Write 1st Draft chapters (cover necessary ideas with minimal mechanics) _quickly_.**
	- Only expand mechanics in first draft enough to resolve an idea at the table. It doesn't have to be perfect, it just has to be functional.

5. **Put all non-core ideas/expansions/diversions/optional systems into a mess file.**

6. **Playtest privately. Playtest extensively. Keep track of what has been tested, passed, or found wanting.**

7. **Confirm mathematical/statistical hypotheses with automation. SAVE YOUR TESTS.**

8. **Distribute a complete (mechanics + setting) draft document to trusted (NDA'd?) groups.**
	- Provide a post-session survey each for players and GMs.
	- Aim for 1,000 person-hours of experience for feedback as a minimum.
		- 83 sessions * 4 people * 3 hours gameplay/session = 996 person-hours.

9. **Chapter rewrites. If more than clarification is required, note the goal of the rewrite.**

10. **PERFECT IS IMPOSSIBLE. Hit a level good enough to learn something and iterate on it.**

11. **Finalize text. Pay for a professional editor.**

12. **Show the game to as many people as you possibly can. Forget secrecy, forget shame. GET FEEDBACK.**

13. **Source B+W art and cartography, plus some color work for the cover (multiple variants?).**
	- Touchstone: Indiana Jones movie poster?

14. **Pay for layout with the intent to print hardcopies.**

15. **Promote! Establish central/official fan node (Reddit, Discord, etc.). RUN GAMES! Local shops, conventions, youtube streams, discord sessions.**

16. **Give away as much as you can for free.** 
	- Full book sans-art? Just a rules PDF? 
	- Make what is necessary to play as free or cheap as possible. 
	- Encourage printing, sharing, and expanding/riffing/remixing.

17. **Establish fictional/setting guidelines, but leave blank spaces to be filled in.**
	- "This is the premise. How does the tension resolve in your personal game?"

18. **If successful... Sell merch?**
	- Dice, shirts, bags, but **nice** stuff. 
	- Tasteful things you'd be proud to display, wear, or use.
