# Magic Items

## Magic Weapons

### Fluff ideas:
Objects are inert; people *want* things. Enchantment means teaching an *object* to want things and giving it the power to achieve those urges. There's a moral component, though--enchanting a sword to *want* to kill means creating a fragment of a mind focused entirely on the desire to slay with none of the framework a human mind would have to contextualize that urge. 

Lesser enchantments are a temporary investment of power in a physical object. The enchantment is consumed over time and through use. Eventually, the invested power drains from the object.

Greater enchantments are a more serious matter. The greater the enchantment, the more volition the object can project on its surroundings and wielder. The most powerful enchanted objects are a constant voice in the ear of those who would carry them. Stories abound of men and women overwhelmed by the singular focus of the legendary objects they carry; as such, most warriors tend to prefer cold steel, even given the option of wielding a lesser enchantment, let alone something truly fantastic.

### Crunch ideas:
- Caster invests Luck/Fate into item; item gains an enchantment usage die. Fate returns to caster when enchantment is expended.
- Permanent enchantments require 1) permanent sacrifice and 2) can only be used by the person who made the sacrifice.

**Lesser enchantments** require temporary markings on the object: painted marks, scratched runes, metallic powders glazed onto the object's surface, a coating of reagent-infused oils, etc.
- A lesser enchantment gains an enchantment usage die; the die is rolled at the end of a combat (or scene?) in which the enchanted object is used. When the die is entirely depleted, the enchantment fades.

**Greater enchantments** require a permanent means of binding an enchantment to an object. Deeply engraved runes filled with mystic metal, a flawless gem bound to a pommel, an reliquiary integrated into a haft, a lesser spirit bound by an etched diagram, etc. There should be no mistaking the difference between objects intended for lesser and greater enchantments.

Powerful enchantments can shatter the objects holding them. A shattered relic releases its stored magic in dangerous and unpredictable ways. To prevent this, objects intended for greater enchantments can be tempered and maintained to improve their durability. An object with a greater enchantment has an Instability Die of a type shown on the table below. At the end of a combat or scene in which the enchanted object was used, roll the object's Instability Die; if it shows a 1, the enchanted object breaks and **[Insert Very Bad Things Here]**.

| Tier | Enchantment Die | Instability Die |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | -- | None |
| 2 | Ud4 | Ud20 |
| 3 | Ud6 | Ud12 |
| 4 | Ud8 | Ud10 |
| 5 | Ud10 | Ud8 |
| 6 | Ud12 | Ud6 |
| 7 | Ud20 | Ud4 |

An enchanted object's Instability Die can be reduced
