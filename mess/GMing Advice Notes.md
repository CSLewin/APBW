Good GMing practices:

Note: Assume "...but be reasonable about it" is appended to every practice.

Use a system the players AND you want to play.

Keep the number of regular players around 4-5 to ensure...
	...everyone gets enough time in the spotlight
	...the GM isn't overwhelmed by combinatoric complexity
	...the social dynamic is a small group rather than a mob/crowd
	...scheduling remains manageable

Use paper character sheets. Offer to print them. Offer to hang on to them.
	Automatic calculation defers system mastery. Basic math is a requirement to play and a good measure of willingess to invest time and effort in the game.

Ask people to keep their phones off the table. Avoid laptops if at all possible.

Run something pre-made first. Use the extra bandwidth to gauge player style and desires.

Likewise, keep it light at the start.

Recognize that the GM's preferred tone/genre may not be want the player group wants and adjust accordingly. Don't run a game that's only fun for half the players (or ONE player).

If it's stressful, adjust things to reduce stress. This is meant to be a fun experience, not a difficult one.

Prepare material for the game. When doing so, always ask "How will this be used in my very next session?"
	If the answer is "It won't be, but..." then you aren't prepping for the session, you're worldbuilding. Is that what you want to be spending your time doing?

Likewise, if it doesn't show up during the game, it doesn't exist. AKA, show, don't tell. If a nation is a military dictatorship, don't write a novella about their admiral; describe groups of soldiers moving through the streets.
	The equivalent of this for players is "If you don't demonstrate it during the game, it's irrelevant to your PC."

Do a post-session recap for the players and a separate one for yourself.
	Player recap: What happened this session? What's the trajectory of the PCs for next session?
	GM recap: What did I need during play, and how can I prep that for next time? Names, stats, locations, etc.

The value proposition for the roleplaying game medium is freedom of choice. Don't tell PCs how they think, feel, or act; give them prompts, ask questions, give more information. Ask for actions, responses, replies. Don't be stingy with information at the micro or macro level.

Especially at the start of the game, provide a strong call to action; none of this "you're standing in a field and know nothing about the world, what do?" nonsense. Interaction through informed decision-making is the core of the game.

Character Creation:
	- Get the players to do it together. Encourage them to riff off of each other. They'll help each other understand the system, too.
	- Consider a theme for the group. Convicts, escaped nuns, dwarfs seeking the lost mountainhome... a concept around which the PCs can unite, even if they use it to play against type.
