# Combat

Sometimes you've just gotta chop heads. Combat basically works like this:
1. Everyone rolls initiative. You roll your good die if you saw it coming; you roll your bad die if it's a surprise. Good dice and bad dice aren't *that* far apart; sometimes the foeman's bad day is better than your best.
2. At the start of your turn, roll your good discipline die to generate **momentum**. Then, spend that momentum to do stuff; costs in momentum are written as **[number]M.**
3. If you're at the right range to Strike your target and you can afford the momentum to do it, it happens. When a foe is out of hits, they're dead (or disabled, if you prefer).

## Initiative

All actors participating in combat roll initiative.
- All actors **aware of danger** roll their **highest** discipline die + Grace. 
- All actors **surprised by danger** roll their **lowest** discipline die + Grace.

This roll becomes the actor's starting momentum. Actors take their turns in the order of their starting momentum, from highest to lowest.

## ACTIONS AND COSTS DURING YOUR TURN: 
- Strike: 4M + Target Defense
- Move: 3M
- Reposition: 2M + Target Defense
- Interact: 2M
- Call Out: 1M
- Use Ability: Per ability description

### Strike
Use your weapon (magical or mundane) to inflict harm on a target.

An actor's defense value adds to the momentum cost of attempting to Strike them.
- *Maissa strikes at a subterranean turtle knight. The turtle knight has a Defense of 2; normally, Maissa's strike would cost 4 momentum, but the knight's Defense of 2 raises the cost to 4 + 2  = 6 momentum.*

Striking to Disable: If you want to merely knock out or disable your target, your Strike costs one additional momentum due to the difficulty of pulling your punches. You must declare your intent to Strike to Disable before paying the momentum cost and learning the result of your blow. If you didn't pay the extra momentum cost and your Strike removes your target's final hit, they're slain despite your best intentions. Combat is dangerous.

### Move
Change your distance relative to something and/or someone else.

***Why would I do this?***
- Some attacks function best--or only work at all--at a specific range relative to the target.

#### Distances and Positions:
- **Intimate**: Close enough to headbutt.
- **Near**: Close enough to spit on.
- **Far**: Close enough to hear angry shouting.
- **Distant**: A couple of football fields at least.

### Reposition
Move to a superior tactical position relative to a single opponent, such as forcing your foe to fight with their back to a pit.

An actor's defense value adds to the momentum cost of attempting to Reposition against them.

***Why would I do this?***
- Some abilities require the user to be in a superior position relative to their target.

### Interact
Retrieve and use an item from a pocket or bag. Alternatively, interact with the environment--open or close a door, pull a lever, flip a table, etc.

### Call Out
Utter anything more complicated than a shout of warning with the intent that a named ally hears and understands you.
- The ally whose you name you call immediately gains 1M. An ally can only gain 1M from Call Out actions per turn.

### Use Ability
Some actors have special abilities or talents. The momentum cost to use them will be listed in that ability's description.

## ACTIONS AND COSTS DURING ANOTHER ACTOR'S TURN: 
- Active Defense: 3M
- Passive Defense: 1M

### Active Defense
Commit significant effort to a Parry, Dodge, or Block against an attack. You may only take this action if you have the momentum to spend on it. Your Parry, Dodge, or Block roll receives a +3 bonus, even if an ability changes the cost of Active Defense.

### Passive Defense
Parry, Dodge, or Block an attack with minimal effort. **You may spend momentum to take this action even if it would result in holding negative momentum,** but your Parry, Dodge, or Block roll suffers a penalty equal to your negative momentum.
