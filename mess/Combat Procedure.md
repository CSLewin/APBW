- Call Out: 1M
- Use Ability: Per ability description

### Strike
Use your weapon (magical or mundane) to inflict harm on a target.

### Move
Change your distance relative to something and/or someone else.

***Why would I do this?***
- Some attacks function best--or work at all--at specific ranges.

### Reposition
Move to a superior tactical position relative to a single opponent, such as forcing your foe to fight with their back to a pit.

***Why would I do this?***
- Some abilities require the user to be in a superior position relative to their target.

#### Distances and Positions:
- **Intimate**: Close enough to headbutt.
- **Near**: Close enough to spit on.
- **Far**: Close enough to hear angry shouting.
- **Distant**: A couple of football fields at least.

### Interact
Retrieve and use an item from a pocket or bag. Alternatively, interact with the environment--open or close a door, pull a lever, flip a table, etc.

### Call Out
Utter anything more complicated than a shout of warning with the intent that a named ally hears and understands you.
- The ally whose you name you call immediately gains 1M. An ally can only gain 1M from Call Out actions per turn.

### Use Ability
Some actors have special abilities or talents. The momentum cost to use them will be listed in that ability's description.

## ACTIONS AND COSTS DURING ANOTHER ACTOR'S TURN: 
- Active Defense: 3M
- Passive Defense: 1M

### Active Defense
Commit significant effort to a Parry, Dodge, or Block against an attack. You may only take this action if you have the momentum to spend on it.

### Passive Defense
Parry, Dodge, or Block an attack with minimal effort. *You may take this action even if it would result in holding negative momentum, but your Parry, Dodge, or Block roll suffers a penalty equal to your negative momentum.*
