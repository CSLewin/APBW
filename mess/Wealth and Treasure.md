# Wealth and Treasure

## Finding Treasure
*Another haul like this, and we can live like kings...*

The value of treasures found are represented by individual dice. *Larger* dice represent individual items of higher value; *More* dice represent greater quantities of treasure.
A treasure's value is a combination of the materials used in it and the artistic value of the object. A 10lb gold bar is not worth as much as a 10lb gold statue sculpted by a master artisan.

| Usage Die | Example | Worth enough to cover about... |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Loose Change | a handful of coins | ...a bad drink or a cheap meal |
| Ud4 | hammered copper bowl | ...a few days of desperate living |
| Ud6 | silver chalice set with onyx | ...a week of common food and lodging |
| Ud8 | gold figurine of a laughing god | ...a week of comfort and mild indulgence |
| Ud10 | etched carnelian cube | ...a week of pampered luxury  |
| Ud12 | faceted emerald pendant | ...two weeks of exotic delights |
| Ud20 | resplendent adamant crown | ...a month envied by princes |

### Hacksilver
*If you can't haul the giant golden statue home, you can at least try to pry out the sapphire eyes.*

Characters can break down treasure--pry out gems, scrape off gold--in an effort to save weight by extracting the most valuable elements of an object at the cost of severely reducing the remaining value of the object. The resulting scraps are generally called hacksilver.

When you break down an object to make hacksilver out of it, reduce the item slots the object would fill by 1. You gain 1 item slot of valuable elements. The treasure usage die of both the original object and the hacksilver are two steps lower than the original item. You can repeat this process until it would produce loose change; beyond that point, nothing of meaningful value remains.

**Summary:** Each hacksilver step = Base item slots -1, 1 item slot of hacksilver produced, value of both decreases two steps from starting value.

*Example: A group of tomb robbers finds a large idol plated in purest gold, with cut sapphires set as the idol's eyes. The idol is massive, a 5 slot object worth Ud20. The group can't get the whole thing out of the tomb and opts to turn it into hacksilver.*
- *First, the idol is reduced from a 5 slot object to a 4 slot object worth Ud10 and produces 1 item slot of hacksilver worth Ud10.*
- *Continuing to work, the idol is again reduced from a 4 slot object to a 3 slot object worth Ud6 and 1 slot of hacksilver worth Ud6.*
- *The robbers continue to scrape the idol for value, finally reducing it to a 2 slot object worth only Loose Change and 1 item slot of hacksilver worth only Loose Change.*

*The tomb robbers gather up two item slots worth of valuable hacksilver (worth Ud10 and Ud6) and leave behind the ruined remnants of the idol and the final leavings, as they're each worth only Loose Change but still take up 1 item slot each.*

## Storing and Investing
*Wealth breeds wealth.*

In the greatest cities of civilization, characters may invest and store their treasures in great banks and temples. This is an inefficient and often exploitative process, but more rogues have retired fat and laughing on the power of compound interest than have claimed petty thrones bought with stolen diamonds. If your character is interested in retiring to a life of luxury, this is the *safest* way to do it...athough not without its own complications.


### Storing Wealth
While in a major city and retaining access to polite society, a character may combine treasure usage dice to produce larger dice. Although any number of dice may be converted in a single go, each such investment requires a week of negotiations, bribes, fees, and taxes; mathematically-talented players may be satisfied to know that this is the pit which absorbs the wealth that vanishes at each step of the process.

Note that this wealth is now only accessible in the city in which it was converted; withdrawing it will require as many days as the usage dice stored in the institution, and each usage die worth of wealth will take up 1 item slot in the form of trade bars of precious metals--large concentrations of which provide prime targets for desperate men and women, should their existence become commonly known.

Petty transactions are beneath the notice of financial institutions; four Loose Change may be combined in one day to produce a small parcel of petty trinkets worth Ud4.

| Combine this... | ...to produce this |
| :---: | :---: |
| 2x Ud4 | 1x Ud6 | 
| 2x Ud6 | 1x Ud8 | 
| 2x Ud8 | 1x Ud10 | 
| 2x Ud10 | 1x Ud12 | 
| 2x Ud12 | 1x Ud20 | 

*Example: Mercurio the Thief would like to find a safer place than beneath his mattress to stash his sacks of orcichalcum orioles, and so approaches the bank of Findlay and Golemshead to sequester his wealth. Since he's not a notorious criminal, the bank agrees to do business with him. All told, Mercurio's treasures constitute 8x Ud6 and 4x Ud8 treasures. After a week of negotiations and the paying of taxes, Mercurio's treasure is consolidated and stored. The individual items making up his hoard vanish into the bank, which converts them: 8x Ud6 becomes 4x Ud8, which are added to the existing 4x Ud8 for a total of 8x Ud8. This converts: 4x Ud10 -> 2x Ud10 -> 1x Ud12.*

*Some months later, Mercurio is advised to quickly flee the city. Mercurio would like to withdraw his entire account into Ud6 treasure dice (in this case, small easily-spent trade bars). The bank converts his funds: 1x Ud12 -> 2x Ud10 -> 4x Ud8 -> 8x Ud6. Eight days later, Mercurio boards a ship bound for foreign shores bearing a suspiciously heavy backpack, trailing the scent of fear-sweat and silver...*

### Investing Wealth
Banks and temples are greatly pleased by reliable clients. Wealth usage dice can be **invested** into a bank. Permanently invested wealth cannot be withdrawn or converted to larger or smaller dice. When a wealth usage die has been invested in a bank for a full year, it decreases one step in size and becomes **durable wealth**. Durable wealth cannot be withdrawn and can only be spent in the city in which it was invested through letters of bank credit. In exchange for these limits, durable wealth usage dice cannot decrease in size when used regardless of the roll result, and are only permanently lost if a result of 1 or lower is rolled on the die twice in a row.

#### My character died, what happened to all of my investments?
The bank took it. It's theirs now. Your heirs are sad that you didn't buy land.
