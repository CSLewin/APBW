# Wealth and Treasure

## Finding Treasure
The value of treasures found are represented by individual dice. *Larger* dice represent individual items of higher value; *More* dice represent greater quantities of treasure.
A treasure's value is a combination of the materials used in it and the artistic value of the object. A 10lb gold bar is not worth as much as a 10lb gold statue sculpted by a master artisan.

### Hacksilver
If you can't a giant gold statue home, you can at least try to pry out the sapphire eyes
