# Wealth and Treasure

## Finding Treasure
*Another haul like this, and we can live like kings...*

The value of treasures found are represented by individual dice. *Larger* dice represent individual items of higher value; *More* dice represent greater quantities of treasure.
A treasure's value is a combination of the materials used in it and the artistic value of the object. A 10lb gold bar is not worth as much as a 10lb gold statue sculpted by a master artisan.

| Usage Die | Example | Worth enough to cover about... |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Loose Change | a handful of coins | ...a bad drink or a cheap meal |
| Ud4 | hammered copper bowl | ...a few days of desperate living |
| Ud6 | silver chalice set with onyx | ...a week of common food and lodging |
| Ud8 | gold figurine of a laughing god | ...a week of comfort and mild indulgence |
| Ud10 | etched carnelian cube | ...a week of pampered luxury  |
| Ud12 | faceted emerald pendant | ...two weeks of exotic delights |
| Ud20 | resplendent adamant crown | ...a month envied by princes |

### Hacksilver
*If you can't haul the giant golden statue home, you can at least try to pry out the sapphire eyes.*

Characters can break down treasure--pry out gems, scrape off gold--in an effort to save weight by extracting the most valuable elements of an object at the cost of severely reducing the remaining value of the object. The resulting scraps are generally called "hacksilver".

When you break down an object to make hacksilver out of it, reduce the item slots the object would fill by 1. You gain 1 item slot of valuable elements. Treasure usage die of both the original object and the hacksilver are two steps lower than the original item. You can repeat this process until it would produce loose change; beyond that point, nothing of meaningful value remains.

**Summary:** Each hacksilver step = Base item slots -1, 1 item slot of hacksilver produced, value of both decreases two steps from starting value.

*Example: A group of tomb robbers finds a large idol plated in pure gold, with cut sapphires set as the idol's eyes. The whole idol is a 5 slot object worth Ud20. The group can't get the whole thing out of the tomb and opts to turn it into hacksilver. First, the idol is reduced from a 5 slot object to a 4 slot object worth Ud10 and produces 1 item slot of hacksilver worth Ud10. Continuing to work, the idol is again reduced from a 4 slot object to a 3 slot object worth Ud6 and 1 slot of Hacksilver worth Ud6. The robbers continue to scrape the idol for value, finally reducing it to a 2 slot object worth only Loose Change and 1 item slot of Hacksilver worth only Loose Change. The tomb robbers gather up two item slots worth of valuable hacksilver (worth Ud10 and Ud6) and leave behind the ruined remnants of the idol and the final leavings worth only Loose Change but taking up 1 entire item slot.*
