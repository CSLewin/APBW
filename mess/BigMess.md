My favorite inventory system has settled out to be "You have slots equal to the higher of your (equivalent to) STR or CON. Most items take up 1 slot. 2h weapons take 2 slots. Light armor is 1 slot, medium is 2, heavy is 3 slots. (50-500, your choice) coins take up one slot. Going over your slots makes you encumbered (per game rules). Being exhausted/tired fills your inventory slots with progressively more instances of "you are too tired to use this slot".

D&D Stats:		DCC:			UVG:		APBW:
Strength		Strength		Strength	Might
Dexterity		Agility			Agility		Grace
Constitution	Stamina			Endurance	Grit
Intelligence	Intelligence	Thought		Lore
Wisdom			Personality		Aura		Charm
Charisma		Luck			Charisma	Fate


APBW ????? (PCs have these stats; monsters do not.)
	Might	- How much force can you muster?
	Grace	- How deft are you?
	Grit	- How long can you endure?
	Charm	- How convincing are you?
	Lore	- How much do you remember?
	Fate	- How lucky are you?

0 is human average. PC stats range can range from -3 to 5 (peak human capability)
Generate stats by rolling 1d20: 
	1-10 (50%): 0
	11-14 (20%): 1
	15-17 (15%): 2
	18-19 (10%): 3
	20 (5%): 4
	20/20 (0.025%): 5

	Survival - Lore

Bonuses to Lore are always specific to a category, never Lore in general.

Rely on heuristics to answer questions, rather than specifics: 
What is the price of a pickaxe?
	Items require (1) Materials, (2) Knowledge of Manufacture, and (3) Means of Production.
		If all three elements are easy to acquire, an item is Common. The base price is 5 + (1d6-3) coins.
		If two elements are easy to acquire, but one is not, an item is Uncommon. The price is 3x the base price.
		If one elements is easy to acquire, but two are not, an item is Rare. The price is 10x the base price.
		If all three elements are not easy to acquire, an item is Exotic. The price is 20x the base price.
Design goals for this: 
	(1) avoiding a giant list of arbitrary prices
	(2) giving a concrete example of "rulings, not rules" 
	(3) de-emphasizing the idea that the book is the sole source of truth/canon about the game



Make rest (1) necessary and (2) interesting. Cooking minigame. 
	recovery requires good rest and healthful food



XP: 
Adjudicating and tracking XP kinda sucks. Milestone XP is too arbitrary--when do you do it? How do the players make decisions that affect it? Let's try something else.

Three GOALS are selected for each PC (from a list of at least 7? 10?).
	The GM picks a GOAL that all PCs in the campaign get.
	The players as a whole agree on a GOAL that all PCs in the campaign get.
	Each individual player selects a GOAL for their PC. It can overlap with the goals of other PCs, but represents what that PC desires.

GOALS are things like: (each one will have a blurb of additional explanation)
	Defeat a deadly foe; Expand the reach of civilization; Map a valuable route or place; Acquire a notable treasure

A PC's list of GOALS might look like this: 
	Level:							|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
	-----------------------------------------------------
	Defeat a deadly foe: 			|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|
	Map a valuable route or place: 	|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|
	Acquire a notable treasure: 	|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|

When a PC accomplishes one of their selected goals, fill in a bubble.
	Level:							|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|
	-----------------------------------------------------
	Defeat a deadly foe: 			|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|
	Map a valuable route or place: 	|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|
	Acquire a notable treasure: 	|●|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|O|


--/1/3/6/10/15/21/28/36/45/55/--
Defeat a worthy foe: 			|●●●●●|●●●●●|●●●●●|●●●●●|●●●●●|
Map a valuable route or place:	|●●●●●|●●●●●|OOOOO|OOOOO|OOOOO|
Acquire a notable treasure:		|●●●●●|●●●●●|●●●●●|●●●●●|OOOOO|

0: --
1: 1 XP
2: 3 XP
3: 6 XP
4: 10 XP
5: 15 XP
6: 21 XP
7: 28 XP
8: 36 XP
9: 45 XP
10: 55 XP

Magic:

Good bits:
	The Goetia/Lesser Key of Solomon. Systematized access to supernatural entities. We live in a society; there are RULES.
	Wonder and Wickedness/Marvels and Malisons; level-less spells. Vancian magic feels like a video game, not being a worker-of-wonders.
	Kabbala. Words. Relationships. Gematria. Latin. Anagrams.

Possession: Demons just add their own parts on top of whatever they're using to manifest. This is how you end up with three-eyed cats.


Written for a 5e conversion, but touching on the Wonder and Wickedness model: 
	You could reduce it to:

	You're a spellcaster. You have (some slightly reduced number of spell slots/day to accommodate this change). You can't take any spell that only does damage any more--they don't exist. Instead, you can sacrifice one of those spell slots to do damage. At character creation, pick one of these types of damage: Acid, Bludgeoning, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Necrotic, Piercing, Poison, Psychic, Radiant, Slashing, Thunder. Any spell slot you use to deal damage is of this damage type.

	If you use a spell slot to deal damage:
	- Pick a target within 30 ft. You must be able to see your target. Make a spell attack roll to affect your target.
	- The spell does damage equal to your caster level in d8s. If you touch your target to deliver the spell, the damage dice are d10s. If your target is more than 30ft away OR you want to affect all targets in a 20ft radius (at any distance), the damage dice are d6s.

	At 3rd level and every 3 levels thereafter:
	- Pick a damage type. Your spell damage can be any of your selected types. If you pick a damage type you already possess, you deal +1 damage per die when using a spell slot to deal damage of that damage type.

	If you are 5th level or higher, you have additional options:
	- On a successful spell attack roll when using a spell slot to deal damage, you may also force the target to make a Dexterity, Constitution, or Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to your spell save. If the target fails the saving throw, they are affected by your choice of the following conditions: Blinded, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, Restrained. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another saving throw. On a success, the condition ends on the target. If a spellcaster uses this option, reduce the size of the damage dice by one step (d10 > d8 > d6 > d4)

	(Warlocks are weird and dumb and special and still get Eldritch Blast force damage in this variant I guess)


	Notes: 

	- This might be best as a sorcerer-adjacent replacement. make up all your spells on the fly; DON'T give access to spell list or it's too much
	- Totally lose access to utility spells, though. 
	- Maybe add Warlock Invocation-style abilities? At that point, aren't we just rewriting the Warlock? Could crib off of worse material, though. Warlock is one of the best-written classes in 5e.

	yeah I'd totally play this if it also got some decent but theme-limited non-combat skills. Maybe Ritual Casting for free and a handful of cantrips (but no cantrip that does damage)

### Combat

Initiative: 
At the start of each round, each PC rolls 2d6 + Grace.
- On a 7+, that PC goes before the enemy. 
- On a 6-, they go after the enemy.

Note: This doesn't account for faster or slower enemies, but it does keep it simple.

Combat rounds play out in four phases:
1. PCs faster than the enemy
2. The enemy
3. PCs slower than the enemy
4. End of the Round

Players may freely determine among themselves the order in which their characters act within a phase.



Attacks:
	Attacks: 1d20 + Might, Grace, or Lore, depending. An attack roll is successful if it is equal to or greater than the target's Defense.

Damage:
	Everyone makes attack rolls the same way. However, your style affects how you determine the results:
		Power: On a hit, roll an additional damage die. Your damage is the sum of the highest two dice. On a miss, you deal no damage.
		Finesse: On a hit, roll an additional damage die. Your damage is the single highest dice. On a miss, deal damage as if you rolled a 1.
