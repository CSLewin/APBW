2. **Core Mechanics**
- Ability Scores  
	- Might	- How much force can you muster?  
	- Grit	- How much can you resist?  
	- Grace	- How deft are you?  
	- Charm	- How convincing are you?  
	- Lore	- How much can you remember?  
	- Fate	- How lucky are you?  
- Ability Checks  
	- How skills affect checks (no skill = flat 2d6; skill = 2d6+stat)
	- ONLY ROLL SKILL CHECKS WHEN SUCCESS AND FAILURE BOTH COULD ADVANCE THE STORY.
- Defenses
	- Armor Class (10 + Grace)
	- Resistance (10 + Higher of Might or Grit)
	- Agility (10 + Higher of Grace or Charm)
	- Discipline (10 + Higher of Lore or Fate)
- Attacks and Damage
