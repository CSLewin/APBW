**Recompense**\
---
Robert E. Howard, Nov 1938


I have not heard lutes beckon me, nor the brazen bugles call,\
But once in the dim of a haunted lea I heard the silence fall.\
I have not heard the regal drum, nor seen the flags unfurled,\
But I have watched the dragons come, fire-eyed, across the world.

I have not seen the horsemen fall before the hurtling host,\
But I have paced a silent hall where each step waked a ghost.\
I have not kissed the tiger-feet of a strange-eyed golden god,\
But I have walked a city's street where no man else had trod.

I have not raised the canopies that shelter revelling kings,\
But I have fled from crimson eyes and black unearthly wings.\
I have not knelt outside the door to kiss a pallid queen,\
But I have seen a ghostly shore that no man else has seen.

I have not seen the standards sweep from keep and castle wall,\
But I have seen a woman leap from a dragon's crimson stall,\
And I have heard strange surges boom that no man heard before,\
And seen a strange black city loom on a mystic night-black shore.

And I have felt the sudden blow of a nameless wind's cold breath,\
And watched the grisly pilgrims go that walk the roads of Death,\
And I have seen black valleys gape, abysses in the gloom,\
And I have fought the deathless Ape that guards the Doors of Doom.

I have not seen the face of Pan, nor mocked the Dryad's haste,\
But I have trailed a dark-eyed Man across a windy waste.\
I have not died as men may die, nor sin as men have sinned,\
But I have reached a misty sky upon a granite wind.
